Palindrome Checker
==================
A [palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)  is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Famous examples include "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Amor, Roma", "race car", "taco cat", and "No 'x' in Nixon".

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------

1. Fork and clone down this repository.
2. Run the program. You should see the following output:  
there are 6 lines  
test is NOT a palidrome.  
rotator is NOT a palidrome.  
rewriter is NOT a palidrome.  
nurses run is NOT a palidrome.  
Madam, I'm Adam! is NOT a palidrome.  
A Man! A Plan! A Canal! Panama! is NOT a palidrome.  
3. You need to finish the `palindrome()` methods 
4. Start by getting the `palindrome()` method to return `true` for `'rotator' and `false` for`'test'` and `'rewriter'`
5. Once you get those three working correctly, you'll need to devise a strategy for working with spaces and capital letters. You may find `String` functions like `charAt()` and `toLowerCase()` helpful
6. Submit the URL of your GitHub repository to the School Loop drop box for the assignment. Note that like the previous two assignments, this assignment has no graphics or website.
